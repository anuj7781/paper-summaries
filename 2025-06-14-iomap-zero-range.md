# Understanding IOMAP Zero-Range Handling: Delalloc, Unwritten Extents, and Brian Foster’s Folio Batch Optimization

## Introduction

This post documents the full data path of buffered I/O in Linux’s iomap infrastructure, covering:

- Delayed allocation (delalloc)
- Unwritten extents
- Extent state transitions
- Pagecache dirty folio state
- Writeback
- And finally, Brian Foster’s optimization for `fallocate(FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE)` over unwritten mappings.

This material is inspired by Brian Foster’s RFC patch series:

## Quick Terminology

| Term          | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iomap->type` | Returned by `iomap_begin()`                                |
| `br_state`    | Filesystem extent state (XFS extent tree)                  |
| DELALLOC      | Delayed allocation: logical reservation, no physical block |
| UNWRITTEN     | Physical blocks allocated, data not yet valid              |
| WRITTEN       | Physical blocks allocated, valid data                      |
| Folio         | Unit of memory inside pagecache                            |

## Buffered Write: Two Scenarios

### 1️⃣ Write into hole (Delayed Allocation)

- `iomap_begin()` returns `IOMAP_DELALLOC`
- Filesystem extent tree stores:

```
br_startblock = NULLBLOCK (delalloc)
br_state = N/A
```

- Dirty folios written into pagecache.

- **Extent state change happens at writeback.**

- At writeback:

```
iomap_write_begin() allocates physical blocks
Extent state updated to WRITTEN
```

---

### 2️⃣ Write into preallocated unwritten extent (Data Conversion)

- `fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)` preallocates physical blocks.
- Filesystem extent:

```
br_startblock = physical block
br_state = UNWRITTEN
```

- `iomap_begin()` returns `IOMAP_UNWRITTEN`.

- On buffered write:

```
iomap_write_begin() triggers data-conversion immediately:
Extent state transitions UNWRITTEN → WRITTEN for written subrange.
```

- Dirty folios written into pagecache.
- **Extent state change happens at write time (before writeback is even queued).**

---

## The Problem with Zero-Range on Unwritten Mappings

When issuing:

```bash
fallocate(FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, offset, length)
```

We may encounter:

- Dirty folios in pagecache overlapping unwritten extents.

- Current kernel forces:

  1. Flush dirty folios (even stale data).
  2. Then apply zero-range.

- This results in:

- 🔴 Unnecessary write I/O

- 🔴 Risk of stale data hitting disk momentarily

- 🔴 Two writes (first flushing stale data, then writing zeros)

---

## Brian Foster’s Optimization

### Key Insight:

> We can avoid flushing dirty folios entirely by locking them directly in pagecache, zeroing them in place, and marking them dirty again.

---

### High-Level Flow:

| Step                 | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iomap_begin()`      | Filesystem gathers dirty folios using `iomap_fill_dirty_folios()` |
| `iomap->fbatch`      | Stores batched dirty folios                                       |
| `IOMAP_F_HAS_FOLIOS` | Flag to signal batch exists                                       |
| `iomap_zero_iter()`  | Walks folio batch and zeroes folios directly                      |

---

### Call Flow:

```c
iomap_zero_range()  
└── iomap_apply()  
    └── iomap_iter()  
        └── xfs_buffered_write_iomap_begin()  
            └── iomap_fill_dirty_folios() (Brian’s hook)  
    └── iomap_zero_iter()  
        └── folio_batch_next() (Brian’s hook)
```

---

### Benefits:

- ✅ No need to flush dirty folios.
- ✅ Avoids race with writeback and reclaim.
- ✅ Cleaner, efficient zero-range implementation.
- ✅ Limited, targeted patch — only modifies `iomap_begin()` and `iomap_zero_iter()`.

## Unified Timeline Example

Let’s walk a concrete example:

| Logical Region | Extent State                    | Pagecache State |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 100–200        | UNWRITTEN                       | No folios       |
| 120–140        | WRITTEN (data-conversion write) | Dirty folios    |
| 140–160        | UNWRITTEN                       | No folios       |

- Zero-range called on 120–160.
- Existing kernel flushes dirty folios on 120–140.
- Brian’s patch locks 120–140 folios, zeroes them directly.

## Worked Example: Dirty Folios Overlapping Unwritten Extents

### Setup

- File region: 100–200
- Preallocated extent: UNWRITTEN
- Buffered write happens on offset 120–140

### After Buffered Write

| Logical Offset | Extent State |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| 100–120        | UNWRITTEN    |
| 120–140        | WRITTEN      |
| 140–200        | UNWRITTEN    |

- Dirty folios exist in pagecache for 120–140

### Zero-range Issued

```bash
fallocate(FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, offset=100, len=100)
```

### iomap\_iter() Splits Subranges

| Subrange | iomap->type      |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 100–120  | IOMAP\_UNWRITTEN |
| 120–140  | IOMAP\_WRITTEN   |
| 140–200  | IOMAP\_UNWRITTEN |

### Folio States in Pagecache

| Logical Offset | Folio Exists? | Dirty? |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 100–120        | No            | N/A    |
| 120–140        | Yes           | Dirty  |
| 140–200        | No            | N/A    |

### Brian's Patch Behavior

- 100–120: zero directly (no folios)
- 120–140: zero dirty folios directly in-place
- 140–200: zero directly (no folios)

## When Does Extent State Change?

| Operation                            | Extent State Transition?                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hole write                           | At writeback                                              |
| Buffered write into unwritten extent | At write time                                             |
| Writeback                            | ❌ No extent state change                                  |
| Zero-range                           | ❌ No extent state change (unless hole allocation happens) |

## Closing

This optimization is a great example of how subtle correctness and performance issues arise when pagecache, filesystem extent state, and iomap mapping logic interact — especially when overlapping dirty data, preallocated unwritten extents, and zero-range syscalls collide.
